## Description
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game would only start when the Tic-Tac-Toe Server runs and two players are connectedto the server. When the game starts, players need to
input their player’s name first (i.e.,the player cannot make any move if he/she does not enter his/her player’s name). Players are not allowed to re-input their names
again once they have submitted their names (i.e., the textboxes and the submit buttons would be disabled). In addition, their names should be displayed in the frame’s
title.

## Game rules
- Players are not allowed to make the next move until his/her opponent moves. If one of the players makes the next move before his/her opponent moves, it would be
  considered as an invalid move and nothing would be displayed on the board.
- The player would win if he/she occupies one of the rows/columns/diagonals.
- The game will draw if no players satisfy the winning condition after all the board location is filled with marks.
- No players are allowed to make further move after the game is ended.
