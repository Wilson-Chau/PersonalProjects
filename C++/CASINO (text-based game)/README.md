### Mini games: 
**1. Blackjack (廿一點)**

In every round, the player would play against the CPU. Initially, the CPU and the player would be given 2 cards. 1 of the 2 cards would be hidden until the end of that game. Player and CPU can ask for 1 more card, or end with the holding card in each turn. At last, if the sum of the player’s cards is greater than CPU’s and not more than 21, the player wins and gains money.
“J,”Q”,”K” are 10, “A” can be 11 or 1.

**2. Slot(老虎機)**

In every round, the player clicks the button to trigger the slot. 3 rows with 3 symbols would be generated. The certain pattern is achieved (same symbol along a row or diagonal), the player gains money. 

If the middle row is '777', player can gain 77x money.

 
**3. Tai-Sai (買大細）**

The player could first guess the total number generated is “big” (大), “small” (細), “triple” (圍骰) . Then three random numbers from 1 to 6 will be generated and their sum would be the total number. If the number is from 3 to 10, it is called “small”. If the total number is from 11 to 18, it is called “big”. If all three numbers are the same, it is called “triple”.
